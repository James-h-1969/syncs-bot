## Bots:
Each bot should include a simple description here of the strategy used to play.

#### Test Bot 1:
This is going to be a simple brute force bot that simply plays whatever tile it can and places the meeple wherever it can. Plan 
is to use this as a way to figure out the structure of how to write bots.
